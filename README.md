## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

After styling the desktop first, and then trying to scale it down, I realized then why most people say that designing the mobile version first is best. It's easier to scale up than it is to scale down. Definitely a teachable moment when you realize you can't get some styles to work correctly when downsizing and you're now having to debate if it'll be worth it to just delete everything and start from scratch.
